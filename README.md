### Follow the instructions explained in the problem video and try to implement a solution on your own. Compare it with my solution (video + downloadable files) thereafter.

**The instructions are:**

1. Create TWO new components: UserInput and UserOutput :heavy_check_mark:
2. UserInput should hold an input element, UserOutput two paragraphs :heavy_check_mark:
3. Output multiple UserOutput components in the App component (any paragraph texts of your choice) :heavy_check_mark:
4. Pass a username (of your choice) to UserOutput via props and display it there :heavy_check_mark:
5. Add state to the App component (=> the username) and pass the username to the UserOutput component :heavy_check_mark:
6. Add a method to manipulate the state (=> an event-handler method) :heavy_check_mark:
7. Pass the event-handler method reference to the UserInput component and bind it to the input-change event :heavy_check_mark:
8. Ensure that the new input entered by the user overwrites the old username passed to UserOutput :heavy_check_mark:
9. Add two-way-binding to your input (in UserInput) to also display the starting username :heavy_check_mark:
10. Add styling of your choice to your components/ elements in the components - both with inline styles - and stylesheets
